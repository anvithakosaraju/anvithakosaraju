## Hello!

### About Me:

My name is Anvitha Kosaraju, and I am currently a junior at Vanderbilt University majoring in Computer Science, Math, and Economics. I am interested in Software Engineering and Project Management positions.

Email Address: anvitha.kosaraju@vanderbilt.edu

#### Experience:
For the Summer of 2020, I was a part of the C-Suite Social Media MIS and technology internship program, and was able to develop a project management experience and also recieve a data science and software development experience. For the Summer of 2019, I was an intern at Vanderbilt University School of Engineering for their Summer Research Program where I worked on a coding project that would create the structure of a multilayer metasurface using optical principles and Meep that could focus multiple inputted wavelengths of light to a specific point. In my free time, I am an Undergraduate Research Assistant at Vanderbilt Univeristy, where I work on code in C++ and ROS for surgical robotics. I have also been learning various machine learning principles and doing fun coding projects in my free time!
